<pre><code>A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.  
This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus&#39;s optimization,
Matthe Bellew&#39;s simplification, Isaku Wada&#39;s real version.

Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
