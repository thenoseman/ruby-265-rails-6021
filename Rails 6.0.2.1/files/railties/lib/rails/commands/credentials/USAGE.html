<h3 id="label-Storing+Encrypted+Credentials+in+Source+Control">Storing Encrypted Credentials in Source Control</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../../../../../classes/Rails.html"><code>Rails</code></a> `credentials` commands provide access to encrypted credentials, so you can safely store access tokens, database passwords, and the like safely inside the app without relying on a mess of ENVs.</p>

<p>This also allows for atomic deploys: no need to coordinate key changes to get everything working as the keys are shipped with the code.</p>

<h3 id="label-Setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Applications after <a href="../../../../../../classes/Rails.html"><code>Rails</code></a> 5.2 automatically have a basic credentials file generated that just contains the secret_key_base used by MessageVerifiers/MessageEncryptors, like the ones signing and encrypting cookies.</p>

<p>For applications created prior to <a href="../../../../../../classes/Rails.html"><code>Rails</code></a> 5.2, we&#39;ll automatically generate a new credentials file in `config/credentials.yml.enc` the first time you run `rails credentials:edit`. If you didn&#39;t have a master key saved in `config/master.key`, that&#39;ll be created too.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t lose this master key! Put it in a password manager your team can access. Should you lose it no one, including you, will be able to access any encrypted credentials.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t commit the key! Add `config/master.key` to your source control&#39;s ignore file. If you use Git, <a href="../../../../../../classes/Rails.html"><code>Rails</code></a> handles this for you.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../../../classes/Rails.html"><code>Rails</code></a> also looks for the master key in `<a href=""RAILS_MASTER_KEY"">ENV</a>`, if that&#39;s easier to manage.</p>

<p>You could prepend that to your server&#39;s start command like this:</p>

<pre><code>RAILS_MASTER_KEY=&quot;very-secret-and-secure&quot; server.start
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Editing+Credentials">Editing Credentials</h3>

<p>This will open a temporary file in `$EDITOR` with the decrypted contents to edit the encrypted credentials.</p>

<p>When the temporary file is next saved the contents are encrypted and written to `config/credentials.yml.enc` while the file itself is destroyed to prevent credentials from leaking.</p>

<h3 id="label-Environment+Specific+Credentials">Environment Specific Credentials</h3>

<p>The `credentials` command supports passing an `â€“environment` option to create an environment specific override. That override will take precedence over the global `config/credentials.yml.enc` file when running in that environment. So:</p>

<pre><code>rails credentials:edit --environment development
</code></pre>

<p>will create `config/credentials/development.yml.enc` with the corresponding encryption key in `config/credentials/development.key` if the credentials file doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The encryption key can also be put in `<a href=""RAILS_MASTER_KEY"">ENV</a>`, which takes precedence over the file encryption key.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the default credentials lookup paths can be overridden through `config.credentials.content_path` and `config.credentials.key_path`.</p>
